# Gear5th
Gear5th is a Game engine unlike any other. It's a game engine, in that you can build impressive 3d scenes, and a game engine in that you can script live into your 3D objects. Besides the obvious Game engine features, Geart5h purpose is another, one could almost describe as visualisation. With Gear5th, you will be able to build impressive visualisations of complex behaviours and algorithms, which makes the engine a convenient solution for school projects and similar things.



# Progress
Once a stable release is showing up here, the engine is working to fulfill it's purpose. Until that, I'm working on it in the early stages. If you have ideas yourself, make sure to create pull requests, I'd be happy.

# Credits
Building such a big project in C++ isn't easy. That is why I make use of many third party libraries to make my own life easier. Of course I leave the license of all of them in my projects, but I find it appropriate to mark other people's work in my README so it's easier to see.
